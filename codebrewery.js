A code brewery is a metaphorical term used to describe the process of creating software in a similar way to brewing beer. Just as a brewer selects ingredients, creates a recipe, and carefully manages the brewing process to produce a high-quality beer, a software developer selects programming languages, frameworks, and libraries, creates a design, and carefully writes and tests code to create high-quality software.
